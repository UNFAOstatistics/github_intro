## Your experience

Do you use Tracking of changes in Microsoft Word or Revision history in Google Drive?

![Example of MS Word tracking of changes. http://www.macworld.com/article/1143163/trackchanges.html](plots/word_tracking.jpg)

## MS Word approach of tracking

* Automatic
* What, but not why
* Distributed

## Why version control for R users?

* Track of your work
* Separate branch for every standalone task (fix or improvement)
* Collaboration

## Git

_noun_ [Ëˆgit]

_British Slang_. A stupid or worthless person (especially a man)

~[Merriam-Webster, Incorporated](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/git)~

* Friendly
    * Human
    * Machine

## Git clone

* In order to make a copy of an existing repo, you must clone it.
* This is not easy in RStudio directly, so you'll have to command line.
* `git clone https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife.git`

## Git add

* When files are changed, they must be added to the staging area
  * This is an area to collect your files before committing

## Git commit

* Committing is like taking a snapshot. You can always go back to an old commit.
* Commits should be accompanied by an informative message

## Git push

* Code ready for the public?
